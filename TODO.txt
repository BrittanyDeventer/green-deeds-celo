TO DO for Britt:
1. Why are whole numbers causing problems?
2. Make celo screen a component to be used in other screens. (maybe two, one for buttons another for user's celo info)


TO DO for all:
1. Safe screen view only works for ios.  Need a wrapper to check platform on component/screen mount.
2. Ensure readme instructions lead to expo demo without issue.
3. Need user's recycling amount to consist throughout screens so Celo component can check before withdrawing from faucet.
